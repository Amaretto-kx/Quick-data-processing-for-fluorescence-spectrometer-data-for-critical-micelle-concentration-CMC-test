# Quick-data-processing-for-fluorescence-spectrometer-data-for-critical-micelle-concentration-CMC-test
This is a quick tool to process fluoresence spectrometer data in .txt exported by Labsolution RF. Including processing triplicate and single set of data. All you need to do is to name your exported data by their concentration. And in the code, you have to change your path of folder. This code will help you graph raw data and CMC prediction.
As your enter your path of files, there will be no errors.
Note: this is for processing triplicate data, but it may still be applicable to single data processing.
The final CMC calculation is based on the average of ratios (384/373) pyrene methods. If you use other methods, change 384 and 373.
